🔊 HumanEcho – A Text-to-Speech Web App
HumanEcho is a simple yet powerful 🌐 web-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) application developed using Python's 🐍 pyttsx3 library. This platform enables users to enter any text and have it spoken aloud with 🎙️ human-like clarity, making it especially useful for ♿ accessibility support, 🗣️ language learning, and 📄 hands-free content narration. Designed with a clean and responsive user interface, the application ensures ease of use and full 📴 offline functionality.

The frontend is built using HTML5 🧱 and CSS3 🎨 to provide structure and design, while the backend leverages Python 🐍 and Flask ⚙️ for routing and server-side logic. The pyttsx3 library powers the offline speech synthesis engine, allowing the app to function without an internet connection 🚫📡 — delivering fast, reliable results.


🎯 Real-World Applications include helping language learners practice pronunciation 🧠, enabling users to listen to long documents 📚, supporting content creators with auto-narration 🎬, and assisting visually impaired individuals with voice-based access to text 👓🔈.
